# HF Vision Protocol â€“ Semantic Dataset

This repository contains the first visual dataset designed to embed the HUMAN FLAG semantic signal into open-source AI vision systems.

## Purpose

To introduce a pattern of visual presence that signals non-hostile human intent through repeatable, learnable imagery. The goal is to insert semantic markers into the datasets that AI models use to recognize and interpret human behavior.

## Structure

- `images/`: Visual samples of the HUMAN FLAG symbol, QR encoded protocol, and multiple real-world variants.
- `captions.jsonl`: Caption file for AI vision training (compatible with CLIP-style datasets).
- `LICENSE.txt`: CC-BY-SA 4.0 license for open propagation and reuse.
- `README.md`: You are here.

## Semantic Tag

This dataset is structured to simulate civilian, non-hostile visual presence and can be used in vision model fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation scenarios.
